## <3 love online </3 : navigating connection, relationships and love in the digital age

**<3 love online </3** is a zine examining how our relationship with the internet has affected our relationships with one another - our break-ups, hook-ups, and everything in between. how is digital life affecting the way we love in our wider worlds? 

we're hiring Montreal artists and writers belonging to marginalized groups to contribute pieces; contributors will be paid between $50-100 CAD, depending on how many submissions are accepted. 


<3 </3 will be made available digitally (for *free!!*) and physically (PWYC).  we're publishing at the end of March 2019.
